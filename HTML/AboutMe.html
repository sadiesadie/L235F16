<font size= "10" color = "red" style = "background-color: yellow"> I want to be a filmmaker. Once, I saw this lady poking a dead fish with a stick. She's on the right. Next to her is a video I took of water creating a glitter effect in a nearby bay. Oh yea, I currently live in upstate New York where I'm attending college. I'm studying film, among other things.   </font>
